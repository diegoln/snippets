# Production startup script for AdvanceWeekly on Google Cloud Run
#
# This script is executed when the Docker container starts in production.
# It performs the following tasks:
# 1. Validates required environment variables
# 2. Runs database migrations using Prisma
# 3. Starts the custom Next.js server on the correct port
#
# Environment Variables Required:
# - DATABASE_URL: PostgreSQL connection string (from Secret Manager)
# - OPENAI_API_KEY: OpenAI API key (from Secret Manager)  
# - PORT: Port to bind server to (provided by Cloud Run, defaults to 8080)
#
# The script uses 'exec' for the final server start to ensure proper
# signal handling for graceful shutdowns in the container environment.
