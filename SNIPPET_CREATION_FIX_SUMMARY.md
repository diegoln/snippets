# Fix Summary: Snippet Creation Issue (#23)

## Overview
Resolved production issue where users were unable to create weekly snippets, receiving "Failed to create new snippet. Please try again." error message.

## Root Cause Analysis
Through runtime log analysis, the issue was identified as a **dual problem**:

1. **Missing Year Column**: Database schema had unique constraint `[userId, weekNumber]` without year, preventing users from creating snippets for same week numbers across different years (e.g., week 30 of 2024 vs 2025).

2. **Authentication Mismatch**: Production environment used database sessions, but authentication utility was expecting JWT tokens, causing 401 errors on authenticated requests.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Fix
- **Added `year` field** to `WeeklySnippet` model
- **Updated unique constraint** from `[userId, weekNumber]` to `[userId, year, weekNumber]`
- **Created migration script** to safely add year column and populate existing records
- **Updated API endpoints** to handle year field in requests/responses

**Files Changed:**
- `prisma/schema.template.prisma` - Added year field and updated constraint
- `app/api/snippets/route.ts` - Include year in creation logic
- `app/AuthenticatedApp.tsx` - Send year field from frontend
- `scripts/migrate-add-year.js` - Database migration script
- `lib/user-scoped-data.ts` - Updated type definitions and queries

### 2. Authentication System Fix
- **Production Environment**: Updated to use database session validation
- **Development Environment**: Maintained JWT token approach
- **Fallback Strategy**: JWT validation if database session lookup fails
- **Cookie Parsing**: Extract session tokens from NextAuth cookies

**Files Changed:**
- `lib/auth-utils.ts` - Complete rewrite to support both session strategies

### 3. Deployment Infrastructure
- **Environment-Aware Schema Generation**: Fixed NODE_ENV handling in Docker builds
- **Runtime Migration**: Added automatic year column migration on startup
- **Debug Logging**: Temporary authentication debugging for troubleshooting

**Files Changed:**
- `start.sh` - Added migration execution and debug logging
- `Dockerfile` - Fixed NODE_ENV setting order
- Various migration files for missing columns

## Verification
- ✅ **Health Check**: `/api/health/schema` reports healthy PostgreSQL connection
- ✅ **Database Migration**: Year column successfully added to production database
- ✅ **Authentication**: Database sessions properly validated in production
- ✅ **Year Field**: Frontend sends year, API processes correctly
- ✅ **Unique Constraint**: Users can create snippets across different years

## Testing Results
**Before Fix:**
- POST `/api/snippets` returned 401 (Authentication Required)
- Database constraint violations for duplicate week numbers
- "Failed to create new snippet" error in UI

**After Fix:**
- POST `/api/snippets` returns 200 with proper user authentication
- Year-aware unique constraints prevent only true duplicates
- Snippet creation works successfully in production

## Impact
- ✅ **Issue #23 Resolved**: Users can now create weekly snippets successfully
- ✅ **Year Boundary Support**: Snippets work across year transitions (2024→2025)
- ✅ **Production Stability**: Authentication system properly handles database sessions
- ✅ **Future-Proof**: Schema supports multi-year snippet history

## Commits Included
- `8fad8bb` - fix: Support database sessions in production authentication
- `32640fc` - debug: Add authentication debugging for production troubleshooting  
- `5a8c300` - fix: Include year field when creating snippets
- `39dc341` - feat: Add proper migration for year column in weekly_snippets
- `be68b1e` - fix: Add missing metadata column migration
- `306f8cd` - fix: Add missing lastSyncAt column migration
- `823f3cc` - fix: Add missing isActive column migration file
- `ddb5333` - fix: Copy scripts directory to Docker runtime stage
- `b46fa35` - fix: Ensure production schema generation with correct NODE_ENV

## Lessons Learned
1. **Always check runtime logs** instead of inferring from code analysis
2. **Environment differences matter**: Dev (JWT) vs Prod (database sessions)
3. **Database constraints need year awareness** for long-running applications
4. **Authentication debugging** is crucial for session-based issues
