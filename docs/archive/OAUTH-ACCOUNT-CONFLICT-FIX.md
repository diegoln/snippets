# üö® OAuth Account Conflict Issue

## ‚úÖ You Identified the Root Cause!

Using the same email (`diegoln@gmail.com`) as both:
- **GCP Project Owner** 
- **OAuth Test User**

This creates several potential conflicts in Google's OAuth system.

## üîç Known Issues with Same Email for GCP + OAuth

### 1. **Project Owner vs Test User Conflict**
- Google treats project owners differently in OAuth flows
- Project owners may bypass normal OAuth restrictions
- Test user restrictions may not apply to project owners
- Can cause "try different account" errors due to permission conflicts

### 2. **Account Linking Problems**
- NextAuth may detect this as an account linking issue
- Same email used in different authentication contexts
- Google's OAuth system may flag this as suspicious activity

### 3. **OAuth Consent Screen Bypass Issues**
- Project owners sometimes bypass consent screens
- This can cause authentication flow interruptions
- Leads to callback errors and authentication failures

## üõ†Ô∏è SOLUTION: Test with Different Email

### Step 1: Create/Use Different Google Account
Use a different Gmail account for testing:
- **Create new account**: `your-name+test@gmail.com` 
- **Or use existing**: Different Gmail account you have access to

### Step 2: Add New Test User
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent?project=advanceweekly-prod
2. In "Test users" section
3. **REMOVE**: `diegoln@gmail.com` 
4. **ADD**: Your alternative email (e.g., `your-name+test@gmail.com`)
5. Save changes

### Step 3: Test with New Account
1. Clear browser cache completely
2. Go to: https://advanceweekly.io
3. Click "Continue with Google"
4. **Sign in with the NEW test account** (not diegoln@gmail.com)

## üéØ Alternative Quick Test

If you don't want to create a new account, try this:

### Temporary Workaround:
1. **Remove yourself from test users list**
2. **Change publishing status to "In production"** (temporarily)
3. **Test authentication** - it should work for project owner
4. **Change back to "Testing"** after confirming OAuth works
5. **Add different email as test user** for ongoing development

## üìã Why This Happens

Google's OAuth system has special handling for:
- **Project owners** - May bypass normal restrictions
- **Test users** - Subject to special test-mode limitations
- **Same email in both roles** - Creates conflicting permissions

## ‚úÖ Expected Result

With a different test user email:
- OAuth flow should work normally
- No more "try different account" errors
- Clean separation between project management and app testing

## üîÑ Long-term Solution

For production apps:
1. **Use separate Google accounts** for:
   - GCP project management (current: diegoln@gmail.com)
   - Application testing (new test account)
2. **Add multiple test users** for team testing
3. **Keep project owner account separate** from app users

**This is a very common issue that many developers encounter when testing OAuth with their own GCP projects!**
