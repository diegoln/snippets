# Loading States Implementation

## Overview
Enhanced the performance assessment generation process with comprehensive loading states and visual feedback to improve user experience during AI-powered draft generation.

## Features Implemented

### ðŸ”„ **Loading States**
- **Button Loading State**: Generate Draft button shows spinner and "Generating..." text
- **Form Disabled State**: All form inputs disabled during generation to prevent changes
- **Visual Feedback**: Loading notification banner with progress information
- **Prevent Multiple Submissions**: Button disabled to prevent duplicate requests

### ðŸŽ¨ **Visual Components**
- **LoadingSpinner Component**: Reusable spinner with customizable size and color
- **Loading Notification**: Informative banner explaining the process
- **Button States**: Clear visual distinction between normal, loading, and disabled states

### âš¡ **User Experience Improvements**
- **Immediate Feedback**: Loading state appears instantly when Generate Draft is clicked
- **Clear Communication**: Users understand the process is happening and AI is working
- **Error Handling**: Failed generations show clear error messages
- **Form Protection**: Prevents accidental form changes during generation

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
const [isDraftGenerating, setIsDraftGenerating] = useState<boolean>(false)

const handleGenerateNewDraft = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
  setIsDraftGenerating(true) // Start loading
  try {
    await onGenerateDraft(formData)
    // Success handling
  } catch (error) {
    // Error handling  
  } finally {
    setIsDraftGenerating(false) // End loading
  }
}
```

### UI Components
- **Generate Draft Button**: Shows spinner and changes text during loading
- **Form Inputs**: Disabled with visual graying during generation
- **Loading Banner**: Blue notification with spinner and descriptive text
- **Cancel Button**: Also disabled during generation

### Error Handling
- Catches generation failures and shows user-friendly error messages
- Loading state properly cleared even on errors
- Error messages can be dismissed by user

## Usage
Users now experience:
1. Click "Generate Draft" button
2. Immediate visual feedback with loading spinner
3. Form becomes disabled (prevents accidental changes)
4. Loading notification appears explaining the process
5. After 60-80 seconds, draft appears or error shows
6. Form returns to normal state

## Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Complete test coverage for LoadingSpinner component
- **Integration Tests**: Loading state behavior in PerformanceAssessment component
- **Edge Cases**: Error handling, multiple submissions prevention

The loading states transform the draft generation from a confusing "black box" process into a transparent, user-friendly experience with clear feedback at every step.
