# Mock Dataset Generation Guide

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for generating realistic mock datasets for testing Google Workspace integration and AI consolidation systems.

## Overview

Our mock datasets simulate authentic workplace dynamics and meeting patterns to train and test AI systems that consolidate workspace data. The datasets include:

- **Google Calendar API v3** event responses
- **Google Meet API v2** transcript entries with realistic conversations  
- **Google Docs API v1** document structures for auto-generated meeting notes

## Documentation Structure

- [**Google Workspace API Formats**](./google-workspace-api-formats.md) - Technical specifications for API response formats
- [**Meeting Conversation Patterns**](./meeting-conversation-patterns.md) - Guidelines for creating authentic dialogue
- [**Narrative Arc Development**](./narrative-arc-development.md) - How to structure compelling character progressions
- [**Data Organization Standards**](./data-organization-standards.md) - File structure and naming conventions
- [**Generation Workflows**](./generation-workflows.md) - Step-by-step processes for creating datasets
- [**Quality Assurance Checklist**](./quality-assurance-checklist.md) - Validation criteria for realistic data

## Example Datasets

- **Jack Thompson (Oct 2024)** - Senior engineer struggling with imposter syndrome and analysis paralysis during JWT authentication project

## Usage

1. Review the API format specifications
2. Define your character's narrative arc and timeline
3. Follow the conversation pattern guidelines
4. Organize data according to the standards
5. Validate against the quality checklist
