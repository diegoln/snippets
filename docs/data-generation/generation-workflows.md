- Add realistic timestamps with appropriate spacing
- Include proper participant identification
- Validate JSON structure and required fields

#### Step 5: Integration Check (15 minutes)
- Ensure consistency with related meetings and timeline
- Verify character behavior aligns with narrative arc
- Check technical discussions match established context
- Update any cross-references in main dataset file

## Workflow 3: Character Arc Development

3. **Implementation Patterns**: Understand realistic approaches and trade-offs
4. **Common Pitfalls**: Research actual problems developers encounter

#### Conversation Development
1. **Problem Introduction**: Character raises realistic technical question or concern
2. **Expert Response**: More experienced colleague provides practical guidance  
3. **Follow-up Questions**: Natural clarification and deeper exploration
4. **Decision Making**: Collaborative approach to choosing implementation path
5. **Action Planning**: Concrete next steps and success criteria

#### Authenticity Checks
- **Complexity Appropriate**: Technical depth matches character experience levels
- **Terminology Natural**: Technical terms used naturally, not as exposition
- **Trade-offs Realistic**: Discussions acknowledge practical constraints
- **Solutions Viable**: Proposed approaches would actually work in practice

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Character Development
- **Over-dramatization**: Keep workplace conflicts realistic and professional
- **Inconsistent expertise**: Don't have characters suddenly gain/lose technical knowledge
- **Unrealistic timeline**: Character changes should feel gradual and earned
- **Perfect resolution**: Real workplace growth is messy and incomplete

### Technical Content
- **Exposition dumping**: Avoid explaining technology that characters would know
- **Theoretical perfection**: Include practical constraints and trade-offs
- **Anachronistic references**: Use technology and practices appropriate for timeframe
- **Over-complexity**: Match technical depth to character experience levels

### Conversation Flow
- **Unnatural speech**: Include filler words, incomplete thoughts, natural interruptions
- **Perfect communication**: Include some confusion and need for clarification
- **Monotone voices**: Each character should have distinct communication patterns
- **Artificial conflict**: Disagreements should be professional and constructive

### API Format
- **Missing required fields**: Validate against official schemas
- **Inconsistent IDs**: Conference IDs must match across related files
- **Timing errors**: Ensure chronological consistency and realistic durations
- **Format deviations**: Follow exact API response structures

Following these workflows ensures creation of high-quality, authentic workplace datasets suitable for training AI consolidation systems while maintaining technical accuracy and narrative authenticity.
