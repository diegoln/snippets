## Common Issues and Solutions

### Character Consistency Problems
**Issue**: Character behavior changes unrealistically between meetings  
**Solution**: Add transitional meetings showing gradual change, validate against character profile

### Technical Inaccuracy  
**Issue**: Technical discussions contain errors or unrealistic approaches  
**Solution**: Research actual implementation patterns, consult domain experts, simplify if needed

### Conversation Unnaturalness
**Issue**: Dialogue sounds scripted or overly formal  
**Solution**: Read conversations aloud, add interruptions and filler words, vary sentence structure

### API Format Errors
**Issue**: JSON doesn't match official Google Workspace schemas  
**Solution**: Validate against published API documentation, use official examples as templates

### Timeline Inconsistencies
**Issue**: Meeting times don't align across different files  
**Solution**: Create master timeline spreadsheet, validate all timestamps against single source

Use this checklist systematically to ensure each dataset meets professional standards for authenticity, accuracy, and utility in training AI consolidation systems.
