### Week 2 (Oct 15-18): Growing Complexity  
- Discovers JWT implementation more complex than anticipated
- Begins asking more detailed questions and seeking validation
- Shows hesitation about architectural decisions
- **Key Meeting**: 1:1 revealing analysis paralysis, daily standup showing uncertainty

### Week 3 (Oct 21-25): Analysis Paralysis Peak
- Overwhelmed by security considerations and edge cases
- Declining performance despite increased research effort
- Withdrawing from team collaboration (declining to help Alex)
- **Key Meeting**: Intervention 1:1 with Sarah, increased support structure

### Week 4 (Oct 28-31): Recovery Through Collaboration
- Intensive pair programming session with Mike breaks through blockers
- Working JWT system implemented focusing on core functionality
- Return to team collaboration and knowledge sharing
- **Key Meeting**: Successful pair programming session, positive wrap-up 1:1

## Technical Context

### Project: JWT Authentication System
- **Requirements**: Secure token generation, refresh token flow, Redis storage
- **Challenges**: Token rotation, concurrent request handling, Redis integration
- **Timeline**: 4-week sprint with increasing pressure
- **Outcome**: Working v1 implementation with simplified scope

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express API endpoints
- **Security**: RS256 JWT signing, SHA-256 token hashing
- **Storage**: Redis for refresh token management with TTL
- **Testing**: Basic unit and integration tests

### Realistic Technical Problems
- Token storage architecture decisions (Redis vs database)
- Refresh token rotation patterns and security implications
- Concurrent request handling during token refresh
- Balancing security best practices with implementation complexity
